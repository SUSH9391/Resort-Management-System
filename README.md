## **Installation**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resort-Management-System.git
cd Resort-Management-System
```

### **2. Set Up the Database**  
1. Start the XAMPP server and ensure both **Apache** and **MySQL** services are running.  
2. Open **PHPMyAdmin** (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).  
3. Create a new database (e.g., `resort_db`).  
4. Import the `resort.sql` file into the database.  

### **3. Configure Database Connection**  
Modify the database credentials in `config.php` (or the relevant file handling database connections):  
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "resort_db";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
```

### **4. Start the Application**  
1. Ensure that the XAMPP server is running with both **Apache** and **MySQL** services.  
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:  
   ```
   http://localhost/Resort-Management-System/php files/index.php
   ```
3. Follow on-screen instructions to register, log in, and manage bookings.

## **Deployment Guide**  

### **1. Hosting Options**  
To deploy the application online, choose a suitable hosting platform:  
- **Shared Hosting** (cPanel-based) â†’ Hostinger, Bluehost, A2 Hosting  
- **Cloud VPS** (manual setup) â†’ AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode  

### **2. Database Setup**  
1. Export the `resort.sql` file from **PHPMyAdmin** (local setup).  
2. Import it into the **live MySQL database** on your hosting provider.  
3. Update `config.php` with **remote database credentials** (provided by the host).  

### **3. Uploading Files**  
- Use **cPanel File Manager** or **FTP (FileZilla)** to upload the project to the `public_html/` directory.  

### **4. Configure Domain and URL Paths**  
- Replace all instances of `http://localhost/...` with the actual **domain name** or **server IP**.  

### **5. Security Considerations**  
âœ… **Disable PHP error display** (`display_errors = Off` in `php.ini`).  
âœ… **Implement HTTPS** (SSL certificate).  
âœ… **Sanitize user input** to prevent SQL injection.  
âœ… **Enable server-side validation** to enhance security.
